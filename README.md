# Voice-Assistant-AYAKA-Using-Python

In this project, I have used certain python libraries to create my personal voice 
assisant named 'AYAKA'. Ayaka can inform about its origin, reason to build. Moreover
she can open google, youtube, Play music, crack jokes in real-time. 

What is a Voice Assistant?
A voice assistant is a digital assistant that uses speech recognition technology 
to interpret and respond to voice commands. Python is a popular programming language 
that can be used to create voice assistants. 

In this article, we will discuss how to create a voice assistant using Python.

                                         **COMPONENTS USED IN THIS PROJECT**
                               
(A) Laptop

A laptop is a portable computer that is designed for use on the go. It typically features 
a thin, lightweight design and a built-in display, keyboard, and touchpad or trackpad for 
input. Laptops are powered by batteries and can be used for several hours without needing 
to be plugged into an outlet.

(B) In-built or external mic

An in-built mic, also known as an integrated microphone, is a microphone that is built into 
a device such as a laptop, smartphone, or tablet. In-built microphones are used for recording 
sound or capturing voice input without the need for an external microphone.

(C) ISE to run the Program

ISE stands for Integrated Software Environment. It refers to a software application that 
provides a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities for designing, developing, testing, 
and deploying software systems or applications.

(D) Active Internet connection

An active internet connection refers to a connection between a device and the internet that 
is currently operational and able to transmit and receive data. It means that the device is 
currently connected to the internet and can access online services such as websites, email,

The Explanation of the program is as follows:

At the beginning, we imported all the necessary python libraries used in this project. The dependencies can be 
installed by following the above stated Pip command. Subprocess module comes in-built with python so there is 
no need to be worry about its installing.

Presently we will set our program to Pyttsx3 which is utilized for text to speech in Python and sapi5 is a 
Microsoft discourse application platform interface that we will involve in our program. We can also change the 
female voice to male voice as ( voices[0].id ), but for best results follow my program...

The main function starts from here, now we will call each & every def function defined in the above code snippet 
in the main function as follows.
